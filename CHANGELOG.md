- **REMOVED**: `CurlInterceptor.withDiscordInspector()` and `CurlInterceptor.withTelegramInspector()` factory methods
- **REMOVED**: `CurlInterceptorV2.withDiscordInspector()` and `CurlInterceptorV2.withTelegramInspector()` factory methods

### Architecture
- Implemented proper MVC + Service Layer pattern with repository pattern

### Features
- Added `enableCaching` parameter to `InspectorUtils` for controlling curl request/response caching

### Enhancements
- Enhanced FormData handling with detailed file info in cURL output
- Improved CurlViewer UI and error handling
- Updated cURL sharing logic and Telegram webhook integration
- Improved code organization and maintainability

### Refactoring
- Cleaned up unused dependencies (`codekit`, `file_saver`) from pubspec.yaml
- Refactored `CurlViewerPopup` to `CurlViewer` with improved UI and display logic
- **REFACTORED**: Moved Discord-specific utilities (`formatEmbedValue`, `_wrapWithBackticks`) from `webhook_utils.dart` to `discord_inspector.dart`

- **IMPROVED**: Code organization with platform-specific utility methods

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive migration guide in [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md)
